# Polities of the World
Polities of the World is an interactive map that displays various demographic, political, economic, and other types of statistics for countries, territories, and other entities around the world.

## What's a Polity?
When we talk about the world, we divide it up into pieces—That helps us discuss what makes one part of the world different from another. Typically we talk about countries: The United States, France, Australia, and the like. Countries are often thought of as the "top" level of government—They don't report up to a level above them. This works fine until we get to a case like the United Kingdom, where the UK is the top level, but the constituent entities like England are still referred to as countries. So sometimes instead we talk about states—Which works great in much of the world, but leads to confusion in the United States, where the constituent entities like Texas are referred to as states. So then we qualify that we mean sovereign states—which clears things up, except that many sovereign states have overseas territories with limited economic, cultural, and historical commonality. And that makes it difficult to do what we wanted to do in the first place: Talk about different parts of the world.

So, polity is a general term, by definition and by design. It just refers to a political entity of interest. Maybe it's a sovereign state, or a country, or a territory, or an autonomous region. Calling something a polity may not tell us how that entity participates on the international stage, but it does give us the ability to segment the world into meaningful pieces so we can investigate, discuss, and gain insights.

## Status
This app is a work in progress. Suggestions and contributions welcome.

## Data Import
The repository includes a Ruby script that can parse a variety of types and structures of data files, matching up the polities in the new data correctly with those in the existing data. It does this in part by having a large thesaurus of alternate names and spellings of polities.
